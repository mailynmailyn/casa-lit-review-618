    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Through this literature review, multiple approaches to perceptual and neural modeling through CASA have been explored, as well as the concept of CASA and ASA themselves. Humans do not seem to think twice about the complex auditory scene processing they perform on a daily basis. In my research, I gradually began to familiarize myself with the patterns in CASA related architecture design, however many of the models contain a mathematical complexity that is difficult to fully grasp. Nevertheless, in understanding overall approaches and theories implemented, I have developed an appreciation of the reach and impact of Bregman’s ASA principles from a psychological perspective. Population-segregation, temporal coherence, spatial tuning and statistical recognition are all neurophysiologically supported algorithmic approaches that echo Bregman’s segregation, grouping and schematic ASA explanations. The inspired models of these processes provide a practical, realistic and challenging angle of ASA. For future reading, I hope to explore more of perceptual and neural CASA models regarding music. Musical scene analysis is its own chapter in Bregman’s ASA book, and it has been discussed that, “to some degree, perceptual ambiguity may participate in our appreciation of music” (Pressnitzer, 2011). Perhaps an interesting follow up question to ‘how do we isolate sound sources?’ is ‘when does the brain favour ambiguity?’
